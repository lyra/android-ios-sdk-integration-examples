## Prerequisites

In order to be able to perform a successful payment with our Mobile SDK you must have: 
* A contract with your Payment service provider.
* A deployed server capable to communicate with the payment platform, in order to verify data and create the payment session (please check out java server sample or the integration documentation for more information).
* Your public key to initialize the SDK. This key can be found in the merchant back-office in Settings -> Shop -> API -> REST API Keys.
* Your REST API Server Name to initialize the SDK. This key can be found in the merchant back-office in Settings -> Shop -> API -> REST API Keys.

The project build setting 'Always_Embed_Swift_Standard_Libraries' is required in YES.



## Getting started

### Execute this sample

1. Clone the repo, `git clone REPO_URL`. 

2. Install the dependencies using CocoaPods by the following command `pod update`.

3. Open the project under Xcode with the `.xcworkspace` file.

3. Edit the following fields in `AppDelegate.m`:
    - **publicKey**: replace with your public key that you can find in your back-office.
    - **apiServerName**: replace with your REST API server name that you can find in your back-office.

4. Edit the following field in `ServerCommunication.m`:
    - **kMerchantServerUrl**: replace by your merchant server url.
    - **username**: replace with your user value for basic authentication in merchant server.
    - **password**: replace with your password value for basic authentication in merchant server.

5. Run it and that's all! :)

### How does it work

#### Initialize the SDK

It is necessary and important to call the `initialize` method of the SDK on the start of your application. 

```objectivec
//Configure SDK options
NSMutableDictionary *configurationOptions = [[NSMutableDictionary alloc] init];
[configurationOptions setValue:apiServerName forKey:Lyra.apiServerName];
 
//Initialize Payment SDK
[Lyra initialize:publicKey :configurationOptions error:&error];
```
The "configurationOptions" parameter corresponds to a Dictionary that allows you to configure the behavior of the SDK. The expected keys in this dictionary are:

| Key             | Value format    | Description                                                        | Required   |
| :-------------------- | :-------- | :----------------------------------------------------------------- | :--------|
| apiServerName         | String    | Your REST API server name that you can find in your back-office. | Required |
| cardScanningEnabled   | Bool    | Enable/Disable the scan card fuctionality. If not set, the functionality will be disable. | Optional |


#### Make a payment

Before calling the `process` method of the SDK to process the payment,  it is necessary to, first, create a session using your server.
In this sample, this is done by the `getPaymentContext` method in ServerCommunication class:

```objectivec
// 1. Init server comunication class for get createPayment context
ServerCommunication *serverComunication = [[ServerCommunication alloc] init];

// 2. Execute getPaymentContext for get the formToken (required param in SDK process method)
[_serverComunication getProcessPaymentContext:^(BOOL getContextSuccess, NSString *formToken, NSError* error) {
...
NSDictionary *objectResponse = [NSJSONSerialization JSONObjectWithData:data options:0 error:&parseError];
NSDictionary *serverResponse = [objectResponse objectForKey:@"answer"];
NSString* formToken = (NSString*)[serverResponse objectForKey:@"formToken"];
     
 }];
```

In this sample, in case of error calling the server, a message will be displayed with the error text.
  
Otherwise, the `process` method is called with the formToken. The formToken is checked and the `process` SDK method is called.

```objectivec
  [Lyra process:self :formToken error:&errorInProcess onSuccess:^(LyraResponse *lyraResponse) {

	//Verify the payment using your server: Check the response integrity by verifying the hash on your server
	[self verifyPayment:lyraResponse];
            
	} onError:^(LyraError *lyraError, LyraResponse *lyraResponse) {
        
		//TODO: Handle Payment SDK error in process payment request
        [self showMessage: [NSString stringWithFormat:@"Payment fail: %@", lyraError.errorMessage]];
            
	} error:&error];
```

The SDK will guide the user through the payment process. When the payment succeed, you will have to check the response integrity on your server. 


*Please check official integration documentation for further information and to check other SDK modes and functionality.* 


## Technology

Developed in Xcode 11.0 and written in Objective-C, this sample app requires iOS 9.0 or superior.

## Troubleshooting

Check official integration documentation in order to check all possible error codes.
